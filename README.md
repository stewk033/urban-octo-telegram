# HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

This assignment requires the update of an existing website in order to make it more accessible. I was given existing code for the Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. website.

## User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

*_GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
*_WHEN I view the source code
*_THEN I find semantic HTML elements
*_WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
*_THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
*_WHEN I view the image elements
*_THEN I find accessible alt attributes
*_WHEN I view the heading attributes
*_THEN they fall in sequential order
*_WHEN I view the title element
*_THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
