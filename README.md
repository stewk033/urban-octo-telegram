# HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

This assignment requires the update of an existing website in order to make it more accessible. I was given existing code for the Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. website.

## User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

* _GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards_
* _WHEN I view the source cod_
* _THEN I find semantic HTML elements_
* _WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements_
* _THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning_
* _WHEN I view the image elements_
* _THEN I find accessible alt attributes_
* _WHEN I view the heading attributes_
* _THEN they fall in sequential order_
* _WHEN I view the title element_
